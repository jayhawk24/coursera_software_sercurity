# Types
## Black Box
- The tool knows nothing about the program ot its input 
- Easy to use and get started but will explore only shallow states unless it gets lucky
- Example Radamsa
-   
## grammar based
- The Tool generates input informed by a grammar
- More work to use to produce the grammar but can go deeper in the state space
- Blab works with regex
  
## White BOx
- The tool generates new input at least partially informed by the code of the program being fuzzed
- Often easy to use but computationally expensive
- Example american Fuzzy Lop
